## Motivation ‚ú®

As a product designer, I think the toast notification is essential for interaction with users. The toast is a good way to send feedback to user's actions in a digital product. In other words, the toast is a good way to interact with users. So I frequently use the toast in my product for interaction with users.

But the toast is difficult to develop. The primary reason is global-state-management. Global-state-management is needed because the toast can be used anywhere in a digital product. The excellent solution is to reuse one toast component importing with `<App />.` This means we no longer have to import the `<Toast />` component whenever we need toast anymore.

`react-toast` is the result of thinking. With `react-toast`, you don't have to worry about state management of the toast notification. Just write the message, show the toast!

<br/>

## Installation

If you use npm:

```
npm i @dalgu/react-toast
```

If you use yarn:

```
yarn add @dalgu/react-toast
```

<br/>

## Usage

### API

React Toast includes a `<ToastProvider />` component, which makes the toast available everywhere of your app when you need notification for user.

```jsx
import { ToastProvider } from '@dalgu/react-toast';

ReactDOM.render(
  <ToastProvider>
    <App />
  </ToastProvider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

<br/>

### Hooks

React Toast provides a custom React hooks `useToast` that allow the toast notification to show to the user.

```jsx
import { useToast } from '@dalgu/react-toast';

const App = () => {
  const { showToast } = useToast();

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => showToast("I'm React Toast!")}>showToast</button>
    </>
  );
};
```

<br/>

## Options as props

| prop       | type      | default | description                        |
| ---------- | --------- | ------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `duration` | `number?` | 2       | Time showing the toast `in second` |
| `zIndex`   | `number?` | 100000  | Set the CSS property `z-index`     |

<br/>

You can use the `Options as props` like the below example. All `Options as props` are optional props. I will add more props `Options as props` in the future.

```jsx
import { ToastProvider } from '@dalgu/react-toast';

ReactDOM.render(
  <ToastProvider duration={3} zIndex={100}>
    <App />
  </ToastProvider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```
